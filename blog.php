            At every moment you can tell if the vibration that you are sending is either a positive one or a negative
            one by identifying the feeling you are experiencing. At every moment you have a feeling and that feeling
            is causing you to emit or send off a vibration – and in the ‘vibrational’ world there are only two kinds
            of vibrations; positive or negative. So as you talk about what you don’t want and make negative declarative
            statements, in that moment you are sending out and emitting a negative vibration. Law of Attraction then
            matches it by giving you more of the same.

            You can reset your vibration from a negative one to a positive one by simply choosing different words
            and different thoughts. It’s as easy as asking yourself, “So what do I want?” As I’ve said before, when
            you talk about what you don’t want and then talk about what you do want the words change. When the words
            change the vibration changes and you can only hold one vibration at a time. In other words, you are
            resetting your vibration. The best news of all is that the Law of Attraction doesn’t remember what
            vibration you were sending out five minutes ago, five days ago, five months ago or 50 years ago. And
            the Law of Attraction doesn’t keep score of how long you may have been sending out or emitting a vibration.
            It’s only checking on the vibration you are offering right now in this very moment and matching it with
            more of the same.

            Remember, the Law of Attraction always matches vibrations in the current moment (hence the expression,
            the point of power is in the present.) You are always at choice as to whether you want to reset your
            vibration or keep it as it is. If you like what you’re getting, celebrate it and in your celebration
            you’ll get more of the same from the Law of Attraction. If you don’t like what you are getting, use
            your reset button to change your vibration which will change the results you are experiencing.
